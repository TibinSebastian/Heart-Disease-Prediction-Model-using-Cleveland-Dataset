# Heart Disease Prediction - Cleveland Dataset

## Overview
This project is a **Machine Learning model** developed to predict the likelihood of heart disease using the **Cleveland Clinic Heart Disease Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aavigan/cleveland-clinic-heart-disease-dataset). The model achieves an **accuracy of 92%**, demonstrating high reliability in classification.

## Dataset

- **Features**:
  - Age  
  - Sex  
  - Chest pain type  
  - Blood pressure  
  - Cholesterol levels  
  - Fasting blood sugar  
  - Resting ECG results  
  - Maximum heart rate achieved  
  - Exercise-induced angina  
  - ST depression induced by exercise  
  - Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
